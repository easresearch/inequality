# Mapping fine-scale socioeconomic inequality using machine learning and remotely sensed data
Pradhan and Agrawal (2025)

This repository contains code for calculating socioeconomic index, inequality estimates using Gini, machine learning model, and uncertainties in predictions using bootstrap technique. The study developed a novel data harmonization method that combines existing household survey data with freely available remotely sensed data and machine learning techniques to generate fine-scale socioeconomic inequality measures across spatial and temporal scales for India.
